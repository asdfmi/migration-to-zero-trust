# Migration to Zero Trust

This repository is a reading-focused guide to migrating from VPN-centered boundary trust to Zero Trust, with
minimal WireGuard-based data-plane MVPs, concrete examples, and phased rollout guidance plus references.

2) Example of a phased migration for a simple environment, assuming the topology has already been made explicit: [docs/OPERATION.md](docs/OPERATION.md)
