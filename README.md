# Migration to Zero Trust

A reading-focused guide to migrating from VPN-centered boundary trust to Zero Trust. This repository pairs background narrative with an MVP stack: controlplane + agent as the product, a per-customer WireGuard enforcer for migration, and protected-resource apps as customer-owned examples to validate the path.
